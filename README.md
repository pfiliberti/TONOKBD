# TONOKBD
A replacement Keyboard for the Tono Theta EX-5000 Digital Communications Terminal

# FIRST EMULATION
This is an attempt to create firstly a solution based on an Arduino that will read the input from a standard PC keyboard and perform the necessary translation and output the proper signals to the Tono so that the software reads the same keypress as pressed on the PC
keyboard.

# SECOND RECONSTRUCTION
Once this works we may proceed further to re-create a full keyboard and the original circuit or equivalent to interface to the TONO and re-create a keyboard that looks and behaves as close to the original as possible.
